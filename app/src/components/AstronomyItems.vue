This apparent brightness is due to its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to the Solar System. Due to it being the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius appears in some of the earliest astronomical records, meaning it was technically dicovered during ancient times. However, the Sirius Star system was discovered in 1844 with the gravitational effects of Sirius B being observed, so that's the discovery year used.
